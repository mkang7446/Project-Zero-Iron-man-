## Information
> This project was inspired by "Tamagotchi" game in 90's. The ultimate goal of this game is to take care of Iron-man(pet in Tamagotchi) until a level gets at maximum level. A player can see the growth of Iron-man and hopefully the player enjoy to watch the process. 

## User stories

1. When a user loads the game, they will see a pop-up modal with explaination of the game and input their name.

2. When a user clicks the start button, the pop-up modal will be closed and main screen will be shown.

3. A user needs to maintain the status of hunger, sleepiness and boredom in order to complete the game.

4. A user can reduce one stat by one click for each status.

5. If any one of stats reaches 10, mission fails and a user will see a pop-up modal of "Game Over" with play again option.

6. As long as a user maintains all stats below 10, level will increase on certain time.

7. Every time the level reaches at particular points, a user will see transitions of images.

8. If a user reaches the maximum of level, mission completes and they will see a pop-up modal with play again option.
